            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                The choice of the medium that I’ve selected is through a video and photo format to capture the feeing of commuting. Through my daily commutes I make to McMaster every single day, I’ve used this medium to capture the how I feel on the commute. Since commuting is such a big part of everyone’s lives, and commuting the same routes hundreds of times a year, at a certain point we no longer observe the surroundings of our commute and let it blend into the background. The message of my project will compress the entire journey and display them through a video of my commute.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project seeks to connect to those who commute, as all of us have the experience of riding and driving over the same stretch of road hundreds of times a year. In the beginning things are clear but as time moves on the more journeys we take the less we see in terms of details that we observe which can be seen in the video during the blending of the frames. As the experiences with the commute lengthens we don’t take time during the commute to enjoy the experiences but we rather use our screens to give us something new, with the increased dependency and usage of displays as an extension of ourselves, from The Gadget Lover, we no longer try to pay as much attention to the passive environment that we experience. Driving and observing our surrounding as the time progresses lets us reflect on how our world changes from day to day, year to year, and we see and participate in this commute with thousands of others in unison. Through this travel we are bonded and confined by the road and our destination.

                It was filmed during the night, as a night drive is often used to process difficult problems or to air the consciousness. The night resonates with being able to conceal to ourselves allowing us to reflect more privately while eliminating the noise of the world through the darkness of the night. The turmoil and how fast time goes and blends together is shown in the video through how frames are blended together and blends more intensely the more the movement. The blending slows down when we are stopped just like how we don’t reflect when we are stopped and observe things more steadily, unlike how speed blends all our surroundings while moving. The blur of the detail is equivalent to how we don’t notice the details of other people while we pass or get passed on the highway, people’s lives are only confined to their own space of thought

            <p>
                The use of the contrast in the images and how it is made to emphasize on the lights is only made to further the effect of the blur of motion and passing of time. The increased contrast makes the dark looks darker and the lights brighter to emphasis what we see and don’t see.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video is what I believe is the best way to convey this message of the passage of time and of our experience such as how we don’t remember every detail of the cars and faces that passes. Through the video and time lapse we can skip details and make use of the blend effect to enhance this experience of both forgetfulness and memory / reflection.
